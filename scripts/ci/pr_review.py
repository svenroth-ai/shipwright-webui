"""Tier-3 PR reviewer — OpenRouter-backed code review for a single PR.

Vendored from the canonical shipwright monorepo. The WebUI has no Python
``shared/``/``plugins/`` tree on the CI runner, so the reviewer lives in-repo
(same convention as ``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# canonical-source-hash: edcdeefba7933382ec3ef01f159785b8bbc4ef300d749d51cd14a22cc0228c33
# canonical-source-repo: https://github.com/svenroth-ai/shipwright
# canonical-source-paths:
#   plugins/shipwright-security/scripts/tools/pr_review.py
# canonical-source-version: iterate-2026-07-27-pr-review-forged-boundary
# canonical-source-hash = sha256(the canonical file's bytes at the version above)
# adaptation (non-logic only — review behaviour is byte-identical to canonical):
#   (1) sibling imports — every `pr_review_*` module lives next to this file in
#       `scripts/ci/`, so the sys.path insert points at SCRIPT_DIR (canonical:
#       PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/lib).
#   (2) default --prompt-dir → `scripts/ci/pr_reviewer`.
#   (3) one docstring paragraph — this repo still runs the SINGLE-stage
#       `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`; the monorepo's two-stage split
#       (#437) is tracked separately and is a `.github/**` change.

Invoked by `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` for Tier-3 PRs only (external
contributors, sensitive paths, or the `needs-review` label). Tier 1/2 PRs
(iterate branches + the maintainer's manual PRs) are NEVER reviewed here — the
tier filter lives in the workflow's `decide` job and `/shipwright-iterate`
Step 8 already covers them in the local subscription.

Steps: fetch the PR diff (`gh pr diff`) → drop producer-generated sections →
refuse to proceed if nothing is left → load system+user prompts → POST to
OpenRouter (`/chat/completions`, strict JSON) → parse the decision → post a
rendered comment + (best-effort) review state → exit per decision.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/pr_review.py \
        --pr-number 42 --repo owner/repo \
        --prompt-dir scripts/ci/pr_reviewer

Environment:
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY          required — OpenRouter credential (never logged)
    SHIPWRIGHT_PR_REVIEW_MODEL  optional — model id (default below)
    GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN     used by the `gh` CLI for diff + comment + review

Exit codes:
    0  decision approve | comment
    1  block — also when nothing/not everything was reviewed (fails closed)
    2  error (no key, OpenRouter down/rate-limited, JSON parse failure, unknown
       decision, prompt/diff fetch failure, a template missing a placeholder)
