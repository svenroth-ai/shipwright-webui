"""Discover the suppressions that are actually in effect, from version control.

Leaf module, deliberately: both the reconciler CLI and the compliance dashboard
need this, and a shared LEAF that each imports by its unique top-level name is
the pattern that keeps them in lockstep without either importing the other's
package (ADR-044/045 — mirrors ``gh_action_tag_owner``, which the security
plugin and the shared ingest path both consume this way).

"In effect" here is scoped to the channels the register's ``target`` vocabulary
can be reconciled against: the Trivy ignore file and the ``SHIPWRIGHT_SEMGREP_*``
env vars in ``security.yml``. It does NOT mean *source-controlled* generally —
an inline ``# nosemgrep`` is source-controlled and in effect, and no ``target``
covers it, so reading the two as equivalent is what makes an inline suppression
look like it needs a register entry. A GitHub code-scanning dismissal is live
API state, not a file, so it is outside this module's reach for the opposite
reason — see ``accepted_risks.STATIC_TARGETS``.

VENDORED into shipwright-webui. This repo has no Python ``shared/`` tree and
CI has no shipwright plugin cache, so the accepted-risk gate ships as a
self-contained copy under ``scripts/ci/`` (same pattern as the vendored
``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# Body below this block is BYTE-IDENTICAL to canonical. Re-verify with a
# CR-normalized diff; Windows CRLF otherwise masks a real divergence.

Drift guard: ``scripts/ci/accepted_risks_vendor.json`` records this file's
sha256 and ``scripts/ci/tests/test_accepted_risks_vendored.py`` recomputes it,
so an in-place edit fails CI unless the manifest is updated too.
