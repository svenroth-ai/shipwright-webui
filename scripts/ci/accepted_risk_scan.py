"""Discover the suppressions that are actually in effect, from version control.

Leaf module, deliberately: both the reconciler CLI and the compliance dashboard
need this, and a shared LEAF that each imports by its unique top-level name is
the pattern that keeps them in lockstep without either importing the other's
package (ADR-044/045 — mirrors ``gh_action_tag_owner``, which the security
plugin and the shared ingest path both consume this way).

"In effect" here is scoped to the channels the register's ``target`` vocabulary
can be reconciled against: the Trivy ignore file and the ``SHIPWRIGHT_SEMGREP_*``
env vars in ``security.yml``. It does NOT mean *source-controlled* generally —
an inline ``# nosemgrep`` is source-controlled and in effect, and no ``target``
covers it, so reading the two as equivalent is what makes an inline suppression
look like it needs a register entry. A GitHub code-scanning dismissal is live
API state, not a file, so it is outside this module's reach for the opposite
reason — see ``accepted_risks.STATIC_TARGETS``.

VENDORED into shipwright-webui. This repo has no Python ``shared/`` tree and
CI has no shipwright plugin cache, so the accepted-risk gate ships as a
self-contained copy under ``scripts/ci/`` (same pattern as the vendored
``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# Use the COMMIT, not the version: the version is an iterate run id and is
# not a git ref, so it cannot be resolved. And the hash is deliberately NOT
# that of a Windows working-tree checkout - with core.autocrlf=true that
# yields a different, unreproducible value. Every canonical hash recorded
# before iterate-2026-07-31-revendor-accepted-risk-gate was that CRLF
# variant, and so matched no upstream blob at all.

Drift guard: ``scripts/ci/accepted_risks_vendor.json`` records this file's
sha256 and ``scripts/ci/tests/test_accepted_risks_vendored.py`` recomputes it,
so an in-place edit fails CI unless the manifest is updated too.

    Mirrors Trivy's own rule rather than its prose (``pkg/result/ignore.go``)::

        !finding.ExpiredAt.IsZero() && finding.ExpiredAt.Before(clock.Now(ctx))

    ``ExpiredAt`` parses with layout ``2006-01-02`` — midnight — so any real
    ``now`` on the date itself is already past it. In date terms an entry lapses
    **from** its ``expired_at``, which is deliberately one day earlier than
    :meth:`accepted_risks.Acceptance.is_expired`. The two are NOT the same
    question and must not be unified: that one asks when the register's own
    re-review falls due, this one asks what the scanner is doing today.

    No date — or one that does not parse — means "no expiry" and keeps the entry
    active. That is the fail-safe direction: an entry counted as active merely
    has to be recorded, whereas one wrongly counted as absent would report a
    live suppression as STALE and send the operator to delete a register entry
    that is doing its job.

    Two disclosed limits of the mirror:

    * **Clock.** Trivy's ``clock.Now(ctx)`` is local time; this resolves
      ``today_utc()``. So on a non-UTC runner the two can disagree for at most
      one day. Deliberate — ``today_utc``'s own docstring gives the reason: the
      register must not flip expired/active between a CI runner and a laptop.
    * **Unparseable dates are over-counted in the YAML form.** Trivy unmarshals
      ``expired_at`` into a ``time.Time``, so ``expired_at: whenever`` makes it
      reject the WHOLE ignore file and suppress nothing; keeping the entry
      active is permissive there. The flat form genuinely tolerates a malformed
      ``exp:``. Not corrected here — the failure contract for a structurally
      invalid ignore file is out of scope for
      iterate-2026-07-31-accepted-risk-gate-holes and filed on its own.
