"""Owner-scoped predicate for ``github-actions-mutable-action-tag`` findings.

Lifted out of ``plugins/shipwright-security/scripts/lib/semgrep_tailoring.py`` so
BOTH the plugin's CI self-scan tailoring AND the shared triage / Control-Grade
artifact-ingest path (``security_findings._findings_from_sarif``) can apply the
SAME accepted-risk drop: the declined-SHA-pin posture (framework decision
2026-06-30) formally accepts mutable tags on GitHub-owned actions
(``actions/*``, ``github/*``). UNPINNED THIRD-PARTY actions stay flagged — that
is the supply-chain guard the rule exists for.

Both channels are opt-in via ``SHIPWRIGHT_SEMGREP_ACCEPT_GH_OWNED_ACTION_TAGS``
and default OFF, so nothing is dropped unless a repo opts in.

Leaf module: stdlib-only, so it imports cleanly from ``shared/scripts/`` (a
sibling top-level import) and from the plugin (via the ``shared/scripts``
sys.path bootstrap, by this UNIQUE top-level name — never ``lib.*``, to avoid the
ADR-045 ``lib`` sys.modules collision in cross-plugin pytest).

Owner is read from the workflow FILE at the finding's line, NOT from the
scanner's matched snippet: semgrep redacts the snippet to "requires login" when
run unauthenticated (as CI does), and a SARIF ``region.snippet`` is redacted the
same way. When the owner can't be determined — file unreadable, line out of
range, no ``uses:`` value, or (at the ingest path) no ``workflow_base`` to
resolve the repo-relative path against — the caller KEEPS the finding: fail
toward the signal, never silently over-suppress.

Accept register: docs/security-ci-setup.md (§ Accepted-risk rule tailoring).

VENDORED into shipwright-webui. This repo has no Python ``shared/`` tree and
CI has no shipwright plugin cache, so the accepted-risk gate ships as a
self-contained copy under ``scripts/ci/`` (same pattern as the vendored
``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# Body below this block is BYTE-IDENTICAL to canonical. Re-verify with a
# CR-normalized diff; Windows CRLF otherwise masks a real divergence.

Drift guard: ``scripts/ci/accepted_risks_vendor.json`` records this file's
sha256 and ``scripts/ci/tests/test_accepted_risks_vendored.py`` recomputes it,
so an in-place edit fails CI unless the manifest is updated too.
