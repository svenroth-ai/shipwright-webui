"""Deciding WHICH superseded verdicts belong to this reviewer — no I/O.

Vendored VERBATIM from the canonical shipwright monorepo. The WebUI has no
Python ``shared/``/``plugins/`` tree on the CI runner, so the reviewer lives
in-repo (same convention as ``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# canonical-source-version: iterate-2026-07-31-it7a-pr-review-stale-verdict (ADR-117)
# adaptation: none — body is byte-identical to canonical. The hash is over the
#   canonical file's bytes AS GIT STORES THEM (LF), not this docstring header and
#   not a CRLF working-tree checkout: a working-tree hash on Windows matches no
#   upstream object at all (learned in webui #341).
#
# DO NOT "tidy" this module. Each guard was narrowed by three upstream review
# rounds against a measured failure, and the rule is duplicated in two
# repositories — hardening it HERE only is drift, and the next re-vendor would
# silently revert it. Findings belong upstream.

Split from `pr_review_dismiss` (which makes the calls) so each half stays inside
the source-size guideline and the rule that decides what may be dismissed can be
read on its own. That rule is the whole safety surface of the feature, so it is
worth reading without the subprocess plumbing around it.

Ownership is *proven*, never inferred:

* every review this reviewer posts carries `<!-- shipwright-pr-review:{nonce} -->`
  as the LAST line of its body;
* the **anchor** is the review carrying THIS run's nonce, so a concurrent run
  cannot become the thing we reason from;
* a candidate must carry a marker of its own — the login cannot stand in for
  that, because every workflow in a repository posts as `github-actions[bot]`
  and matching on it would sweep up other workflows' change-requests;
* a candidate must be a `Bot`, so a human who quotes this reviewer's text into
  their own review is out of reach;
* and nothing happens at all unless the commit this run REVIEWED, the pull
  request's current head, and the commit its own review is stamped with are all
  the same commit.

That last chain needs all three terms, and it is easy to think two suffice.
GitHub stamps a review's ``commit_id`` at SUBMISSION time — the head as it was
when the review landed, NOT the commit whose diff was read. So
`anchor.commit_id == head` alone says only "the head has not moved since I
posted": a run that reviewed X while the head advanced to Z is stamped Z, passes
that test, and would retract a live verdict about the intermediate commit Y.
The reviewed SHA comes in from the caller, which is what makes the guard mean
what it claims.

Verdicts posted before this shipped carry no marker and are therefore never
cleared. That is deliberate: proving ownership matters more than rescuing a
backlog which, when this was written, was empty.
