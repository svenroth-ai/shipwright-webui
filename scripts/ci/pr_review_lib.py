"""Pure helpers for the Tier-3 PR reviewer (no network / no subprocess).

Vendored from the canonical shipwright monorepo. The WebUI has no Python
``shared/``/``plugins/`` tree on the CI runner, so the reviewer lives in-repo
(same convention as ``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# canonical-source-repo: https://github.com/svenroth-ai/shipwright
# canonical-source-paths:
#   plugins/shipwright-security/scripts/lib/pr_review_lib.py
# canonical-source-version: iterate-2026-07-27-pr-review-forged-boundary
# canonical-source-hash = sha256(the canonical file's bytes at the version above)
# adaptation: none — the body is byte-identical to canonical below the docstring
#   (the sibling modules it re-exports from are vendored next to it, so the
#   import lines need no re-pointing).

Split out of ``scripts/ci/pr_review.py`` so the I/O-free review logic stays small
and unit-testable, and the tool script stays under the source-size guideline.
This module is now the pure-logic core only — redaction, prompt loading, the
template fill, diff truncation, response parsing and the decision → exit-code
mapping. Diff filtering (``pr_review_diff_filter``) and rendering
(``pr_review_render``) live in their own modules and are re-exported here for
existing callers; the two I/O boundaries (``pr_review_gh``,
``pr_review_openrouter``) are reached through ``pr_review`` itself. See B4.5 in
the monorepo's ``Spec/early-access-readiness-plan.md``.
