"""The OpenRouter HTTP boundary for the Tier-3 PR reviewer.

Vendored from the canonical shipwright monorepo. The WebUI has no Python
``shared/``/``plugins/`` tree on the CI runner, so the reviewer lives in-repo
(same convention as ``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# canonical-source-hash: 09877c0ea17cb11a1d6b0c3cd8901b06b5f0dd2ffc69bca9ce403d6997bacb02
# canonical-source-repo: https://github.com/svenroth-ai/shipwright
# canonical-source-paths:
#   plugins/shipwright-security/scripts/lib/pr_review_openrouter.py
# canonical-source-version: iterate-2026-07-27-pr-review-forged-boundary
# canonical-source-hash = sha256(the canonical file's bytes at the version above)
# adaptation (non-logic only):
#   OpenRouter attribution headers (HTTP-Referer / X-Title) name the webui repo.

The second of the tool's two I/O boundaries — ``pr_review_gh`` owns the
subprocess one. Both are split out of ``pr_review.py`` so it holds orchestration
only and stays under the source-size guideline, and so each boundary (with its
timeout, its error mapping and, here, its Semgrep suppression) is reviewable on
its own.

Stdlib urllib only: the script carries no third-party HTTP dependency and runs
under whatever environment the CI runner's Python resolves.
