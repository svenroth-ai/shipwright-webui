"""Scanner-agnostic accepted-risk register — the single human-authored record.

Accepting a security finding used to mean doing one of three unrelated things,
only one of which a human ever saw again:

* ``.trivyignore.yaml`` — SCA only, but the **only** channel carrying a due date
  (``expired_at``), surfaced by the compliance dashboard as ``EXPIRED — re-review``;
* ``SHIPWRIGHT_SEMGREP_*`` env vars in ``security.yml`` — SAST rules, no expiry,
  rationale living in a prose table in ``docs/security-ci-setup.md``;
* a manual dismissal in the GitHub Security tab — no expiry, invisible from the repo.

Because the expiry was bolted to the Trivy channel, webui had to register a
**Semgrep / CI-posture** decision inside a **Trivy** ignore file just to obtain a
due date — an acknowledged semantic stretch, and the direct motivation for this
module (triage ``trg-15a8e267``, item 4 of ``trg-9509c2e8``).

``shipwright_accepted_risks.yaml`` records the acceptance; the scanner wiring is
deliberately left where it is. A both-directions drift gate
(``tools/accepted_risks_cli.py check``) ties the two together, which buys the
single-record property without turning a live security gate into a generated
artifact.

**Validation is unforgiving on purpose.** An acceptance silences a real security
signal, so a half-filled entry is an ERROR, never a skipped row — a skipped row
reads as "nothing accepted" while the suppression stays live, which is precisely
the state this register exists to make impossible.

**Absent is not malformed** (external review, GPT #8). An absent register is a
legacy or fresh repo and reads as empty; a present-but-malformed one fails
closed. Collapsing the two would let one broken edit read as "all entries
removed" and, downstream in ``alert_convergence``, license a mass-dismissal off
a truncated file.

**Absent is not exempt, either.** Reading as empty means the drift gate
reconciles it *like* an empty register, not that it skips the comparison —
otherwise deleting this file would silence the gate while every suppression it
recorded stayed live (iterate-2026-07-31-accepted-risk-gate-holes).

VENDORED into shipwright-webui. This repo has no Python ``shared/`` tree and
CI has no shipwright plugin cache, so the accepted-risk gate ships as a
self-contained copy under ``scripts/ci/`` (same pattern as the vendored
``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

#
# Use the COMMIT, not the version: the version is an iterate run id and is
# not a git ref, so it cannot be resolved. And the hash is deliberately NOT
# that of a Windows working-tree checkout - with core.autocrlf=true that
# yields a different, unreproducible value. Every canonical hash recorded
# before iterate-2026-07-31-revendor-accepted-risk-gate was that CRLF
# variant, and so matched no upstream blob at all.

Drift guard: ``scripts/ci/accepted_risks_vendor.json`` records this file's
sha256 and ``scripts/ci/tests/test_accepted_risks_vendored.py`` recomputes it,
so an in-place edit fails CI unless the manifest is updated too.
