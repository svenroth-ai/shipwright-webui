"""Human- and model-facing rendering for the Tier-3 PR reviewer.

Vendored from the canonical shipwright monorepo. The WebUI has no Python
``shared/``/``plugins/`` tree on the CI runner, so the reviewer lives in-repo
(same convention as ``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# canonical-source-hash = sha256(the canonical file's bytes at the version above)
# adaptation (declared, behaviour-identical):
#   ``_UNSAFE_IN_DISPLAY`` is assembled from explicit CODEPOINTS instead of the
#   literal characters canonical embeds in its regex string. Same alphabet,
#   verified character-for-character by the test module — but a reviewer of an
#   invisible-character BLOCKLIST can actually SEE what is in it, and the class
#   itself contains no literal invisible characters, so no editor, terminal or
#   diff tool can silently mangle it. (The file is not ASCII-only overall — the
#   truncation marker and the comment badges are not — but the table is.)
#   Equality with canonical's literal class is pinned codepoint-by-codepoint, in
#   BOTH directions, by
#   `test_pr_review_safe_path.test_the_alphabet_equals_canonicals_literal_class`.

Everything that turns a review result into text someone reads: the model-facing
metadata block, the PR comment, and the sanitiser both go through. Split out of
``pr_review_lib`` when that file passed the source-size guideline.

Path names rendered here come from the PR's own diff, so on an untrusted PR they
are attacker-chosen. ``safe_path`` is the one chokepoint.
