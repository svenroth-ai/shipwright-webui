"""Unified-diff parsing for the Tier-3 PR reviewer — the MECHANISM.

Vendored from the canonical shipwright monorepo. The WebUI has no Python
``shared/``/``plugins/`` tree on the CI runner, so the reviewer lives in-repo
(same convention as ``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

Where a file section begins and ends, which paths it touches, where the size cap
may cut, and which sections the generated-artifact policy drops. That policy —
*what counts as generated* — lives in ``pr_review_generated``, because it changes
for a different reason (a new producer) and its over-reach is a security bug,
not a parsing bug.

The single definition of "a file boundary" lives here, so the generated filter
and the size cap can never disagree about where one file ends. It is LF-anchored:
git ends a diff line at LF and nothing else, and a parser that thinks otherwise
lets a PR forge a boundary from inside its own hunk (see ``_split_sections``).

    **Split on LF only.** A content line in a unified diff carries a ``+``, ``-``
    or space prefix, so a header at the start of a *git* line is always a real
