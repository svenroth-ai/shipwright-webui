"""Reconcile the accepted-risk register against the suppressions actually in place.

The register (``shipwright_accepted_risks.yaml``) is the human-authored RECORD;
the scanner wiring (``.trivyignore*``, the ``SHIPWRIGHT_SEMGREP_*`` env vars in
``security.yml``) is what actually suppresses. Keeping them as two files only
works if something proves they agree — otherwise the register is documentation
that drifts, which is the failure mode it was built to end.

Two subcommands, both offline and read-only:

``check``    both directions. A suppression with no register entry is an
             UNRECORDED acceptance (nobody knows why it is there or when to
             re-review it). A register entry with no suppression is a STALE
             record (it claims something is accepted that no longer is).
``expire``   fails when an acceptance is past its re-review date.

Both are wired into ``.github/workflows/security.yml`` (job
``Accepted-risk register (gate)``) so they run on every PR AND on the existing
weekly schedule. The schedule is the load-bearing half for ``expire``: expiry is
TIME-based, not diff-based, so a PR-only gate would never fire on an entry that
lapses while nobody happens to open a PR. A gate nothing invokes constrains
nothing.

**``github-dismissal`` entries are NOT checked by ``check``** and are reported
as unchecked there. Their counterpart is live GitHub alert state, not a file, so
the offline gate cannot see them. Printing what was skipped is deliberate — a
gate that silently narrows its own scope reads as "all clear".

Resolving those entries is what canonical's ``converge`` subcommand does, and it
is **deliberately absent from this vendored copy** — see the ADAPTED note below.

VENDORED into shipwright-webui. This repo has no Python ``shared/`` tree and
CI has no shipwright plugin cache, so the accepted-risk gate ships as a
self-contained copy under ``scripts/ci/`` (same pattern as the vendored
``scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py``).

# canonical-source-repo: https://github.com/svenroth-ai/shipwright

# canonical-source-version: iterate-2026-07-29-accepted-risk-ci-gate
#
# ADAPTED - NOT byte-identical to canonical:
#   `converge` is REMOVED. It resolves github-dismissal entries against live
#   GitHub state and can mass-dismiss alerts; canonical says no scheduled job
#   may hold that authority. A CI copy that CANNOT converge enforces that
#   structurally rather than by convention. Removing it also drops the
#   `github_code_scanning` import, so this gate stays offline and stdlib-only
#   (plus PyYAML). Run `converge` from the plugin when it is needed.
#   `_SCRIPTS_ROOT` points at this file's own directory: the vendored modules
#   are siblings under scripts/ci/, not a shared/scripts tree.
#   A missing PyYAML now exits 2 with an actionable message instead of dying on
#   an unhandled traceback with exit 1 - which is the SAME code as real drift,
#   so a gate that could not run read as a gate that ran and found something.
#   Found by running the CI steps verbatim against a Python without PyYAML.

Drift guard: ``scripts/ci/accepted_risks_vendor.json`` records this file's
sha256 and ``scripts/ci/tests/test_accepted_risks_vendored.py`` recomputes it,
so an in-place edit fails CI unless the manifest is updated too.
