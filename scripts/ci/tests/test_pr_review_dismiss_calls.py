"""Tests for pr_review_dismiss's two `gh`-facing entry points.

`dismiss_own_stale_verdicts` and `read_reviewed_head` are the halves of the
module that make calls. Both are best-effort by contract: the verdict is already
posted and the required check already reflects it, so every failure here has to
be reported and then dropped. Split from `test_pr_review_dismiss.py` (which
keeps the pure selection logic) to stay inside the source-size guideline.
