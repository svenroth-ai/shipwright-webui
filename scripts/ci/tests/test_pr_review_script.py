"""Tests for scripts/ci/pr_review.py — the Tier-3 PR reviewer (orchestration).

The OpenRouter-backed reviewer `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` runs on Tier-3
PRs (external contributors, sensitive paths, `needs-review` label). It must fetch
the diff, drop producer-generated sections, REFUSE to proceed when nothing is
left, call OpenRouter, parse a strict-JSON decision, post a comment, and map that
decision to an exit code (0 approve/comment, 1 block, 2 error); dump the raw
response redacted and exit 2 on a parse failure; cut an over-cap diff at a FILE
BOUNDARY and FAIL CLOSED on the partial review that leaves, naming what went
unreviewed; and never log the API key.

The pure helpers live in `pr_review_lib` / `pr_review_diff_filter` /
`pr_review_render` and the two I/O boundaries in `pr_review_gh` /
`pr_review_openrouter`, each with its own test module. Every network and `gh`
boundary is monkeypatched here, so the suite runs fully offline.

Vendored from the canonical monorepo (plugins/shipwright-security/tests/
test_pr_review_script.py); paths re-pointed to the WebUI's flat `scripts/ci/`
layout.
