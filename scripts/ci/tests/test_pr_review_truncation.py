"""Tests for truncate_diff_at_boundary — cutting an over-cap diff safely.

The Tier-3 reviewer fails CLOSED on a diff it could not read in full, so how the
cut is made decides two things: whether the reviewer sees syntactically whole
files, and whether a human can tell WHICH files nobody looked at.

Vendored from the canonical monorepo (plugins/shipwright-security/tests/
test_pr_review_truncation.py); fixture paths re-pointed to the WebUI tree.
