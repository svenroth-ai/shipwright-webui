"""Tests for pr_review.main() — WHEN this reviewer may retract its own verdicts.

`pr_review_dismiss` decides *which* review is stale; this module pins the far
narrower question the orchestration owns: a run may clear its own earlier
change-requests only when it has itself just passed, and that housekeeping can
never change what the review earned. Split from `test_pr_review_script.py` to
keep both modules inside the source-size guideline.

The wiring here is deliberately its own, smaller than that module's: these tests
care about the posted review-state body and whether the cleanup ran, not about
what reached the model.

Vendored from the canonical monorepo (plugins/shipwright-security/tests/
test_pr_review_stale_verdicts.py, ADR-117); paths re-pointed to the WebUI's flat
`scripts/ci/` layout. Canonical's `test_an_unreviewable_diff_clears_nothing` was
absent here for as long as this repo had no generated-artifact diff filter to
give it meaning; `test_a_fully_filtered_diff_clears_nothing` below is that case,
added once `pr_review_diff_filter` / `pr_review_generated` landed (merged
forward from iterate-2026-07-28-pr-review-parity) and made it constructible —
without it, the interaction between THIS module's fail-closed branch (nothing
left to review) and ADR-117's cleanup gate had no regression coverage at all.
