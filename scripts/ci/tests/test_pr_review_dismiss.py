"""Tests for scripts/lib/pr_review_dismiss_select.py — WHICH verdicts are ours.

A `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review is not retracted by a later `COMMENTED` one, so a
fail-closed Tier-3 verdict outlives the commit it was about and holds the pull
request at `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` with every check green and no open thread
(measured on PR #446: five such verdicts, six clean reviews after them). This
module decides WHICH of them are ours to clear; `pr_review_dismiss` makes the
calls.

The whole risk of that is over-reach, so most of what is pinned here is what the
selection must REFUSE to touch: a human's change-request, another bot's, another
workflow's under the same `github-actions[bot]` login, one about the commit that
is currently checked out, and any verdict whose ownership cannot be proven.
