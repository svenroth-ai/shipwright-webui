READ THIS BEFORE OPENING THE PR
================================================================================
Most AI-generated PRs to this repo are rejected. Not because the code is
bad — because the process around the code is skipped. The questions
below exist to stop that. Fill them in completely; PRs that leave them
blank or paste fluff like "n/a — small change" are closed without review.

If you are an AI agent (Claude, Codex, Copilot, …):
  1. You may not open this PR until a human has approved the approach
     in a preceding issue, ADR, or iterate spec.
  2. You may not open this PR if a duplicate already exists (search
     `is:pr in:title <keywords>` in BOTH open and closed PRs first).
  3. You may not open this PR if any unchecked statement below is
     still unverified. "I think it passes" is not verification.

## Human Authorization

> **Iron Law:** NO PR WITHOUT A HUMAN-APPROVED APPROACH FIRST.
> (See `CONTRIBUTING.md` — changes to launch/transcript/security
> surfaces require an issue or ADR; all other changes require either
> an issue, an iterate spec, or an ADR.)

- [ ] A human reviewed and approved the approach before code was written.
- [ ] Approval is linked: issue, ADR, or iterate-spec → #_____ /
      `path/to/spec.md` / `path/to/adr.md`.

## Duplicate Search

> **Iron Law:** NO PR WITHOUT A DUPLICATE SEARCH FIRST.

- [ ] Searched **open AND closed** PRs for the same change.
- [ ] No duplicate found, OR: this PR explicitly supersedes #____ (note
      why).

## Summary

<!-- What does this PR do? One or two sentences. Concrete, not vague. -->

## Motivation

<!-- Why is this change needed? Link the issue / ADR / spec. -->

Closes #

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation / comments
- [ ] Tests only
- [ ] Refactor (no functional change)
- [ ] Build / CI / tooling

## Verification

> **Iron Law:** NO PR WITHOUT EMPIRICAL VERIFICATION FIRST.
> Each statement below is a claim about reality. If you cannot point at
> a command, a log, a screenshot, or a test output that proves it, do
> not check the box — go run it.

- [ ] Tests added or updated where applicable, AND **the new tests fail
      without my change** (verified by running them on the base SHA).
- [ ] Full relevant test suite run locally; **exit code 0** captured in
      the Test Plan below (paste the last 10 lines or attach a log link).
      Typical: `make test`, `cd server && npm test`, `cd client && npm test`,
      `npx playwright test` for E2E.
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode clean: `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit` and
      `cd client && npx tsc --noEmit`; exit code 0.
- [ ] Linter passes: `cd server && npm run lint` and
      `cd client && npm run lint`.
- [ ] Anti-ratchet check clean:
      `python scripts/hooks/anti_ratchet_check.py --worktree` exits 0.
- [ ] No "all tests pass" claim when output shows failures — actual
      numbers reported below.

## Test Plan

<!--
Paste the EXACT commands run and the LAST FEW LINES of their output.
Screenshots welcome for UI changes. "It works on my machine" is not a
test plan.
-->

```
$ <command>
<output excerpt>
```

## Anti-Slop Self-Check

> Apply the four Karpathy principles (from the sibling shipwright repo's
> `shared/constitution.md`, "Pre-Phase Principles") to this diff before
> requesting review.

- [ ] **Think Before Coding** — The linked issue/ADR/spec captures the
      problem, at least one alternative considered, and the decision.
- [ ] **Simplicity First** — No premature abstractions, no single-use
      helpers, no flags with one caller. Three similar lines beat a
      wrong-shape abstraction.
- [ ] **Surgical Changes** — Every file in this diff is here for the
      stated intent. Bug-fix scope = bug. Refactor scope = refactor.
      Docs scope = docs. Mixed scope = split into separate PRs.
- [ ] **Goal-Driven Execution** — Every edit traces back to an
      acceptance criterion, FR, ADR, or iterate intent. No drive-by
      improvements without a goal.

## High-Sensitivity Change?

<!--
Check if this touches any of these load-bearing webui areas. These
have hard architectural rules in CLAUDE.md and decision_log.md — see
ADR-034, ADR-067, ADR-068, ADR-068-A1, ADR-101 (cross-process lock).
-->

- [ ] **Launch / transcript model** — anything in `server/src/launch/`,
      `server/src/transcript/`, the pty-manager whitelist, or the
      JSONL-discovery code. **MUST not let the server spawn `claude`
      directly** (ADR-067 + ADR-068-A1).
- [ ] **Embedded terminal pane** — `client/src/components/Terminal/*`
      or related WebSocket data-frames.
- [ ] **Stateless transcript reads** — anything that would put
      per-session byte-offset cache on the server (forbidden, ADR
      Rule 2).
- [ ] **Triage / cross-process lock** — anything that writes to
      `<project>/.shipwright/triage.jsonl` from webui. **MUST use
      `proper-lockfile`** (ADR-101).
- [ ] **Contract surface with Shipwright plugins** — anything the
      sibling [`shipwright`](https://github.com/svenroth-ai/shipwright)
      repo reads/writes (`shipwright_*_config.json`,
      `.shipwright/agent_docs/*`, `shipwright_events.jsonl`).
- [ ] CI/CD workflows (`.github/workflows/`).
- [ ] New external dependency (npm package).
- [ ] None of the above.

If any box is checked, link the preceding design issue or ADR: #____ /
`.shipwright/agent_docs/decision_log.md::ADR-NNN`.

## Checklist (mechanical)

- [ ] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- [ ] Commits are signed off (`git commit -s`).
- [ ] Documentation updated where applicable
      (`CLAUDE.md` / `docs/guide.md` / relevant ADR).
- [ ] For load-bearing surface changes: I opened an issue first and had
      the approach approved.
