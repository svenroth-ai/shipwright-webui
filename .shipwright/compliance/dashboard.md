## ✅ Control Verdict

> **Under full control. Primarily capped by requirement traceability.**

### Control Grade: **A** (99/100) — Under full control.

| | Dimension | Signal | Anchor |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| ✅ | Requirement traceability | 42/42 FRs covered; 233/257 changes traced (FR-linked or classified no-FR) | requirement-to-work traceability (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148) |
| ✅ | Test health | latest full suite 3500/3500 (2026-06-30) | automated tests pass (OpenSSF Scorecard) |
| ✅ | Change traceability | 257/257 changes linked to a commit, ADR or test run | change provenance (SLSA) |
| ✅ | Change reconciliation | 0/23 behavior-touched FRs not re-verified | re-verify changed requirements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207) |
| ✅ | Security | 0 open high/critical | no open high/critical vulns (NIST SSDF) |
| ✅ | Size / maintainability discipline | ratchet delta +0 lines (net growth) | no unchecked code-size growth (ISO/IEC 25010) |
| ✅ | Dependency hygiene | 0 unresolved / 66 licenses; 0 copyleft | dependency license & risk (OWASP) |

Verified from: `shipwright_events.jsonl (257 events, 2026-05-01 → 2026-06-30)`

_Grade = importance-weighted average over the measurable dimensions (n/a excluded from the denominator), modeled on OpenSSF Scorecard. Age is neutral; only unreconciled change and net growth are control failures. Each Anchor names the open standard the dimension follows — see the guide's Control-Grade dimensions table._

## 🛡️ CI Security (fail-closed gate)

Latest scan: **2026-06-29** · source `security.yml#28407935303` · critical-gate **✅ PASS**

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 |
| Medium | 0 |
| Low | 12 |

Prompt-injection findings: **0**

_Ingested from CI `findings.json` (public-safe: severity counts + gate verdict only — no finding detail). The local `.shipwright/securityreports/` is intentionally **not** used (stale/FP-laden). Open high/critical feed the Control Grade's Security dimension._

## Quality Indicators

| Metric | Value | Status | Why warn? |

| Pipeline phases completed | n/a (adopted) | INFO |  |
| Work events (iterate) | 187 changes | INFO |  |
| Recent changes traced to an FR | 17/30 (57%) | INFO | feature vs. maintenance mix — informational, does not affect the Control Grade |
| All unit tests passing | 3500/3500 | PASS |  |
| Architecture decisions | 200 ADRs | INFO |  |
| Iterate tests passing | 71/114 testable changes tested | WARN | 43 testable change(s) without tests — see test-evidence.md |
| Dependencies | 66 packages | INFO |  |
| Copyleft risk | 0 | PASS |  |
| Triage open | 2 open | WARN | 2 actionable item(s) — see ../agent_docs/triage_inbox.md |
| Bloat over-limit (grandfathered) | 80 | INFO |  |
| Bloat in allowlist | 85 entries | INFO |  |
| Bloat ratchet delta | +0 lines | PASS |  |

## Project Velocity

## 🔎 Consistency Audit

Detective audit (2026-05-22): **FAIL — drift found** · 16 checks — 10 pass, 2 fail, 4 skip.

_Inlined from `audit-report.json` (a gitignored transient — no external link, so this stays visible on the public repo)._
