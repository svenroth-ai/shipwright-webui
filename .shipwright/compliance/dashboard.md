## ✅ Control Verdict

> **Under full control. Primarily capped by requirement traceability.**

### Control Grade: **A** (99/100) — Under full control.

| | Dimension | Signal | Anchor |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| ✅ | Requirement traceability | 41/41 FRs covered; 227/251 changes traced (FR-linked or classified no-FR) | requirement-to-work traceability (DO-178C, IEC 62304) |
| ✅ | Test health | latest full suite 3464/3464 (2026-06-28) | automated tests pass (OpenSSF Scorecard) |
| ✅ | Change traceability | 251/251 changes linked to a commit, ADR or test run | change provenance (SLSA, OpenSSF Scorecard) |
| ✅ | Change reconciliation | 0/22 behavior-touched FRs not re-verified | re-verify changed requirements (DO-178C, ISO 26262) |
| ✅ | Security | 0 open high/critical | no open high/critical vulns (NIST SSDF, OWASP) |
| ✅ | Size / maintainability discipline | ratchet delta +0 lines (net growth) | no unchecked code-size growth (ISO/IEC 25010) |
| ✅ | Dependency hygiene | 0 unresolved / 66 licenses; 0 copyleft | dependency license & risk (OWASP, OpenSSF Scorecard) |

Verified from: `shipwright_events.jsonl (251 events, 2026-05-01 → 2026-06-29)`

_Grade = importance-weighted average over the measurable dimensions (n/a excluded from the denominator), modeled on OpenSSF Scorecard. Age is neutral; only unreconciled change and net growth are control failures. Each Anchor names the open standard the dimension follows — see the guide's Control-Grade dimensions table._

## 🛡️ CI Security (fail-closed gate)

Latest scan: **2026-06-28** · source `security.yml#28336942429` · critical-gate **✅ PASS**

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 |
| Medium | 0 |
| Low | 130 |

Prompt-injection findings: **0**

_Ingested from CI `findings.json` (public-safe: severity counts + gate verdict only — no finding detail). The local `.shipwright/securityreports/` is intentionally **not** used (stale/FP-laden). Open high/critical feed the Control Grade's Security dimension._
