# Shipwright Command Center (WebUI)

## WHAT
- **Purpose**: Local web application for managing multiple Shipwright SDLC projects in parallel.
- **Architecture**: Hono backend (Node.js) + React 19 frontend (Vite 6), monorepo in `webui/`. **External-launch model (Plan D'' variant a, 2026-04-19)**: webui owns no Claude subprocess. The user runs Claude Code in their own terminal via a pre-bound `--session-id <uuid>` copy-command; webui observes the resulting JSONL at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`.
- **Stack**: TypeScript strict, Hono, React 19, Vite 6, TailwindCSS 4, Radix UI, TanStack React Query.

## Architecture reference

Plan of record: [`~/.claude/plans/plan-d-double-prime-external-launch.md`](../.claude/plans/plan-d-double-prime-external-launch.md).
PoC findings that shaped the implementation: [`~/.claude/plans/external-launch-poc-results.md`](../.claude/plans/external-launch-poc-results.md).
Decision record: `agent_docs/decision_log.md` ADR-034.

Two hard rules, survivors of every review round:
1. **Webui spawns no Claude process.** Users launch in their own terminal; webui observes the JSONL.
2. **Server is stateless on transcript reads.** Client passes `?fromByte=<offset>&expectFingerprint=<fp>`; no per-session byte-offset cache lives server-side. Multi-tab works by construction.

## HOW

### Development

This repo has **no root `package.json`** — `server/` and `client/` are independent workspaces. Run each in its own terminal:

```bash
# Install (once)
cd server && npm install
cd client && npm install

# Terminal 1 — Hono backend (tsx watch, port 3847)
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Vite client (port 5173 by default, proxies /api to 3847)
cd client && npm run dev
```

Other scripts (run from the respective subdir):

```bash
npm run build                 # Production build
npm run test                  # Vitest
npm run test:e2e              # Playwright (client only)
npm run lint                  # ESLint
npm run typecheck             # tsc --noEmit
```

### Key Environment Variables
```
PORT=3847                     # Hono server port (override via env)
VITE_PORT=5173                # Vite dev server port (override via env)
```

Default is a single dev-server stack. For parallel worktrees set both vars explicitly — see [shipwright docs/guide.md §8.5 "Parallel Development with Worktrees"](https://github.com/svenroth-ai/shipwright/blob/main/docs/guide.md#85-parallel-development-with-worktrees). The Vite proxy reads `PORT` at startup so `/api` routes to the matching Hono instance.

### Profile resolution (post-split)

This repo ships bundled stack profiles at `server/profiles/`. The loader
(`server/src/core/profile-loader.ts`) resolves in this order:

1. `SHIPWRIGHT_PROFILES_DIR` — explicit override.
2. `SHIPWRIGHT_MONOREPO_PATH` + `/shared/profiles` — dev-loop helper for
   when you're iterating on the shipwright monorepo and want live edits
   to take effect without re-syncing the snapshot.
3. Bundled `server/profiles/` (default).

The snapshot is a copy of `shipwright/shared/profiles/`. Refresh via
`npm run sync-profiles` (from `server/`) or copy manually. See
`server/profiles/README.md`.

### Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode everywhere.
- Hono routes in `server/src/routes/`, one file per resource. External-launch routes live at `server/src/external/routes.ts`.
- React components in `client/src/components/`, grouped by UI area.
- TanStack React Query for data fetching + sequential polling for transcript updates.
- TailwindCSS 4 for styling, Radix UI for accessible primitives.
- Files under 300 lines — split if larger.
- Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, docs:, chore:).

### Architecture rules (post-Plan-D'' + Iterate 2)
1. **Webui never spawns Claude.** Launchers produce command strings; the user pastes them. Regression guard: Playwright spec `35-no-chat-panel.spec.ts`.
2. **Task state is derived from `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl` + the persistent store.** Session UUID is pre-bound at task creation via `crypto.randomUUID()`.
3. **Discovery is filename-first.** `<uuid>.jsonl` is the primary match (PoC finding 1); first-line sessionId is a secondary sanity check.
4. **Transcript endpoint is stateless.** `GET /api/external/tasks/:id/transcript?fromByte=<n>&expectFingerprint=<fp>` — multi-tab support comes for free.
5. **UTF-8-safe chunking.** Server reads are cut on `\n` boundaries only.
6. **Torn-read retry budget.** `core/session-watcher.ts` retries EBUSY/EPERM/EACCES/ENOENT up to 6 attempts with 50→1600 ms backoff.
7. **No SSE for transcript.** Sequential 1 s polling on the client via `useTaskTranscript`.
8. **No chokidar.** Heartbeat-free; watcher state is derived on demand from mtime probes.
9. **Plugin dirs must be re-passed on every launch.** `--plugin-dir` does not reliably survive `--resume`.
10. **MIN_SUPPORTED_CLI is pinned.** See `core/cli-compat.ts`. Anything older shows a banner via `/api/diagnostics`.

### Preview-capability precedence (Iterate 3, plan § 2.1)

Iterate 3 introduces a Preview dev-server spawn path (not Claude — see ADR-044). Three sources interact:

1. **Profile `stack.frontend` presence** — the capability gate (is this project a frontend project at all?).
2. **Profile `dev_server.command`** — the spawn target (which command actually starts the dev-server).
3. **`.webui/actions.json` → `actions.preview.enabled`** — the policy override (user-level opt-out).

`stack.frontend` AND `dev_server.command` must both be present for `<PreviewButton>` to render. `actions.preview.enabled = false` hides it regardless. Boot-time coherence check warns when `stack.frontend` is set but `dev_server.command` is missing (button would render, spawn would 500). The full diagram lives in [`agent_docs/architecture.md`](agent_docs/architecture.md).

### DO-NOT regression guards (Iterate 2 / ADR-035)
1. **DO NOT write into Claude's JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects/`.** Webui is a read-only polling observer of that directory. Title sync uses Claude's first-party `--name` CLI flag at launch time, not JSONL mutation or a sidecar file.
2. **Auto-scroll pattern is CSS-first.** `overflow-anchor: auto` + `scroll-padding` on the scroll container is the primary path. `useAutoScroll` (ResizeObserver-light, ref-based, ~50 LOC) is the safety net for Chrome+polling cases. Do NOT reach for stale libraries like `react-scroll-to-bottom`. See ADR-035.
3. **DO NOT re-introduce a chat composer.** External-launch architecture is load-bearing. See ADR-034. Spec 35 fails the build if a chat-* surface re-appears.
4. **DO NOT re-add `@assistant-ui/*` packages.** Rendering is bespoke via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `rehype-highlight` + `strip-ansi`. The full stack is in `client/package.json` already.
5. **DO NOT run `claude --resume <uuid>` as a webui-initiated side-effect command** while the user's session may be active in their terminal. SQLite lock + JSONL interleave risk (EBUSY on Windows). Title updates take effect on next user-initiated launch only.
6. **Multi-writer state files** (`sdk-sessions.json`, any future sidecars) MUST use `proper-lockfile`, not just temp-file + rename. The PATCH /tasks/:id endpoint surfaces ELOCKED as 409 so the client can retry instead of silently overwriting.
7. **TSC baseline:** server has 4 pre-existing errors (cross-package imports + missing `@types/proper-lockfile`). Policy is "no regression" — new code must compile clean; existing errors are tracked but not required to fix in this iterate.
8. (Iterate 3 — ADR-044) **Schema v2 is write-on-touch.** `sdk-sessions.json` v1 rows load as `projectId: "unassigned"` in memory and rewrite to v2 on next mutation. DO NOT batch-rewrite on boot — ADR-038 explicitly rejected that path. The `schemaVersion` header field must load both v1 and v2 during the forward-compat window.
9. (Iterate 3 — ADR-044) **Preview spawn uses `shell: false`.** User-controlled `dev_server.command` strings + `shell: true` would be command-injection. All Preview subprocess entrypoints flow through `core/preview-session-manager.ts`, which tokenizes the command and spawns with `shell: false`. DO NOT add a parallel spawn path.
10. (Iterate 3 — ADR-044) **Path-guard is `realpath + path.relative`, NOT `startsWith`.** Symlinks, unicode, and Windows junction points defeat prefix checks. All tree + file routes share `core/path-guard.ts`; null-byte input is hard-rejected.
11. (Iterate 3 — ADR-044) **DO NOT hardcode `shipwright-run` / `shipwright-iterate` / phase strings (`build`, `plan`, `design`, …) in components** — read from `/api/external/projects/:id/actions`. Violations re-introduce the configurability debt iterate 3 paid down and will cause custom `.webui/actions.json` installations to break silently. Meta-test `client/src/test/doc-sync.test.ts` keeps this file-map honest; grep your component for `shipwright-` literals before committing.
12. (iterate/multi-session-run-orchestrator-v2) **DO NOT write into the user's `shipwright_run_config.json`.** WebUI is a read-only observer of run-config. The framework's orchestrator owns every mutation; the only webui write surface remains `sdk-sessions.json` + `.webui/actions.json` stub creation (existing). All run-config consumption flows through `core/run-config-reader.ts` (server) and `useRunConfig()` (client).
13. (iterate/multi-session-run-orchestrator-v2) **Phase-task launches must use the pre-bound `sessionUuid` from the run-config — never re-generate.** The `/launch` route's `phaseTaskRef` branch re-reads run-config server-side and rejects mismatched session-uuids (`409 phase_task_session_uuid_mismatch`). The client never sends `sessionUuid` / `slashCommand` directly; only `phaseTaskRef.phaseTaskId`. Also: `phaseTaskRef` and `actionId` are mutually exclusive (`400 mixed_launch_intents`).
14. (iterate/multi-session-run-orchestrator-v2) **All pipeline-continuation entry points share `useContinuePipeline()`.** Master TaskCard CTA + Continue Pipeline modal + future TaskDetail header all funnel through the single hook so re-fetch + idempotent shadow-task lookup + verified launch happen as one atomic unit. Adding a parallel launch path bypasses the staleness re-check and re-introduces the race the architecture closes.
15. (iterate/multi-session-run-orchestrator-v2) **Schema v3 is additive + write-on-touch.** `sdk-sessions.json` gains optional `phaseTaskId` / `runId` / `parentRunMaster` fields. Loader accepts v1 + v2 + v3; persist always writes v3. Same forward-compat window as ADR-038. DO NOT batch-rewrite on boot.
16. (iterate/multi-session-run-orchestrator-v2) **Stale `in_progress` detection uses run-config timestamps only.** `phase_task.startedAt` / `claimAttemptedAt` against `config.updated_at` — never JSONL mtime. WebUI must not depend on observing JSONL files for tasks it doesn't own a shadow of.

### Title integration (`--name`)

Webui owns the task title in `sdk-sessions.json`. Every launch command (initial OR resume) emits `--name "<title>"` after `--session-id` / `--resume`. Claude pre-seeds the picker title from this flag and produces `custom-title` + `agent-name` events in the JSONL. There is no mid-session sync. Renames take effect on the NEXT user-initiated launch — see `core/launcher.ts`, `external/routes.ts` PATCH handler, and `client/src/components/external/EditableTaskTitle.tsx`.

### Dev-server troubleshooting

If recent code changes don't show up in the running webui, `tsx watch` has
probably gone stale on Windows. Kill the PID on :3847 explicitly:

```bash
# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :3847
taskkill //F //PID <pid>
cd server && npm run dev
```

If `npm run dev` fails with `EADDRINUSE`, another worktree's dev server may
be running on the same port. Since v0.3.2 the Hono server exits with a
deterministic operator message:

```
FATAL: Port 3847 is in use. Override via PORT=<other> or stop the
existing process (e.g. "npm run dev:fresh" or netstat/taskkill).
```

`EACCES` and `EADDRNOTAVAIL` get analogous loud messages. Vite already
fails loud via `strictPort: true` in `client/vite.config.ts` — so both
halves of the stack now refuse to silently half-start.

`npm run dev:fresh` (the dev-restart.js helper) reads `PORT` and
`VITE_PORT` from the environment. Kill scope is limited to the two
configured ports — it never reaches beyond them. The historic
`VITE_ALT_PORT=5177` hardcode was removed in v0.3.2 because it broke the
per-worktree contract; if you happen to run Vite on 5177, set
`VITE_PORT=5177` explicitly.
