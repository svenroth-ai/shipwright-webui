## Historical attribution

### `MarkdownContent` — MIT (ported, 2026-04-11)

- Originally adapted from [The-Vibe-Company/companion](https://github.com/The-Vibe-Company/companion) under MIT. The current component lives at `client/src/components/chat/MarkdownContent.tsx`. If the assistant-ui migration ends up removing every chat callsite of this component (verified per Sub-iterate A grep policy), the file may still be used by viewer/explorer code — do not delete without a full grep.
